### 🧭 **Product Vision Statement: Memory Map Action Planner**[](https://dev.azure.com/Claudio-Coaching/PEP%20Memory%20Map%20\(basic%20DevOps%20process\)/_wiki/wikis/PEP-Memory-Map.wiki/1/Product-Vision-Statement?anchor=%F0%9F%A7%AD-**product-vision-statement%3A-memory-map-action-planner**)

> **We are building a cloud-based visual planning tool that transforms the powerful ideation method of Memory Mapping into a structured, actionable plan.**

Initially developed to support executive coaching under the Personal Efficiency Program (PEP), this software allows users to brainstorm ideas visually, sequence tasks, estimate time requirements, and export clean, trackable action plans — all in one seamless experience.

Unlike traditional mind-mapping tools, our solution integrates essential planning elements:

- invested time,
- elapsed time,
- task sequencing,
- exportable action plans with assignment and scheduling.

It empowers users to move effortlessly between creative thinking and disciplined execution.

> Our long-term vision is to democratize structured visual planning for individuals and teams by offering an intuitive platform that bridges creativity and accountability, enabling progress with clarity and confidence.
